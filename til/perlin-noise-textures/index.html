    <article>This other day, I was looking up ways to create synthetic data to capture foggy patterns in endoscopic videos as a side project for my mid-term. I found out that perlin noise can be used to create realistic textures at low computational overhead and provide temporal consistency across frames due to its pseudo-random changes to variables. Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise and can be created in three simple steps.
## Setup
Input Point: Let the input point be (x,y), located inside a grid cell.
Grid Cell: The cell is defined by its four corner points (candidate points) at integer coordinates:
Bottom-left: (i,j), where i =⌊x⌋, j=⌊y⌋.
Bottom-right: (i+1,j)
Top-left: (i, j+1)
Top-right: (i+1,j+1)
Gradient Vectors: Each corner has a random gradient vector (a 2D unit vector), denoted:
g\_{00} at (i,j),
g\_{01} at (i+1,j),
g\_{10} at (i,j+1),
g\_{11} at (i+1,j+1),
Distance Vectors: For each corner, the distance vector from the corner to the input point (x,y) is:</article>
