##Transformers
A Transformer is a type of neural network architecture that can be trained as an autoregressive language model. In these notes, we will focus on the special case of Transformer-based
autoregressive LMs, and refer to these as Transformers for short. Note that it is also possible to use Transformers in other ways. In addition, we will follow one particular common
Transformer variant, but many slight variants are also possible and in use.
