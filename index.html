    <h1>Gaurav</h1>
    <p>I like building things that work well and feel simple. Mostly with code, sometimes just an idea I'm curious enough to try. I am an engineer interested in all things tech and humans. This space is where I leave traces of what I've built and what I'm becoming. If you find something useful here, great. If not - I had fun anyway.</p>
