        <p>When I’m not working or learning, you’ll probably find me doing one of these:</p>

        <p>Out of the billions of possibilities, if we happen to cross paths in public, you’ll most likely find me with earphones in. I love listening to music.</p>

        <p><strong>Some of my favorite artists & genres:</strong><br>
        Rock — Nirvana, Queen, Agnee<br>
        Alternative — The Strokes, The Neighbourhood, Franz Ferdinand<br>
        Metal — AC/DC, Black Sabbath<br>
        Special mention: Foster the People</p>

        <p>I play guitar and occasionally make (mediocre) music on <a href="https://suno.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_LINK" target="_blank">suno.com</a></p>

        <p>I play chess — mostly over the board with friends.</p>

        <p>I also enjoy taking my dog out for walks — it’s one of the best parts of my day.</p>

        <p>Books have never quite been my thing, but I do love listening to podcasts — they’ve become my favorite way to explore new ideas.</p>
